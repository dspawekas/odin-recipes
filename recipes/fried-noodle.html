    <p>If you've never had this dish, it's basically like a noodle pancake that's extremely crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, coated in a delicious savory gravy along with a variety of tasty vegetables and meats.</p>
    <p>Even though this dish is commonly known as Hong Kong-style noodles or Hong Kong chow mein, the name is a little misleading, as it's not originally from Hong Kong, nor is it stir-fried, which is what the word "chow" would suggest.</p>
    <p>As my dad alluded to, the original name is léuhng mihn wòhng (兩面黃), which means yellow or golden on both sides. It originated in the Suzhou / Shanghai area, and was brought down to Hong Kong in the 1950s with the wave of Shanghainese immigrants.</p>
    <p>From there, the dish quickly caught fire as Hong Kong chefs adapted the unique technique of letting the noodles slowly form a crispy layer on each side. Nowadays, léuhng mihn wòhng (兩面黃) or Hong Kong style noodles are enjoyed all around the world.</p>
